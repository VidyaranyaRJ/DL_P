write a summary at the end
making the model read different language books




This code loads data from several books, preprocesses it, trains a LSTM model on the data, and saves the model. 
It also extracts the main character from the combined sentences using spaCy's named entity recognition. The sentences 
are split into training and testing sets and the model is trained using padded sequences and categorical targets.

One potential issue with this code is that it loads all the sentences into memory before shuffling and splitting them 
into training and testing sets. This can be problematic if the combined sentences are very large and consume a lot of memory.
A possible solution to this issue is to use a generator to stream the data in smaller batches instead of loading all of it 
into memory at once. Another potential issue is that the code only extracts the main character from the combined sentences, 
but it doesn't associate the main character with the specific book they appear in. To address this issue, the code could be 
modified to keep track of the book URL or name for each sentence and associate the main character with the corresponding 
book.

# Find the index of the predicted main character in the target sequences
pred_main_char_index = tf.argmax(tf.reduce_sum(new_book_target[:, :, main_char_index], axis=1)).numpy()

# Find the sentence containing the predicted main character
pred_main_char_sentence = new_book_sentences[pred_main_char_index][1]

print("The predicted main character is:", new_book_main_character)
print("The sentence containing the predicted main character is:", pred_main_char_sentence)


Try different architectures: The current architecture consists of three stacked LSTM layers followed by three dense layers. 
Experimenting with different architectures such as using bidirectional LSTMs or different combinations of layers may improve 
the accuracy.

Use pre-trained embeddings: Instead of learning word embeddings from scratch, you can use pre-trained word embeddings 
such as GloVe or Word2Vec. This can help the model to better capture the meaning of the words and improve its accuracy.
